## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

This set of notebooks involves the following instructions for seamless execution:

### Part 0: Initial Setup <a name="part-0-initial-setup"></a>

1. Start with a Data Science (DS) notebook.
2. Read the introduction in the DS notebook.
3. Go to the DO1 notebook.
4. Run the first command in the DO1 notebook and copy the ID.
5. Return to the DS notebook and insert the ID in the `join_duet` function.
6. Copy the indicated code (CLIENT ID) from the DS notebook.
7. Return to the DO1 notebook and insert the code in a dedicated field.
8. Repeat the procedure for the DO2 notebook.

Note: If you use `join_duet(loopback=True)` and `launch_duet(loopback=True)`, you do not need to insert any codes as the notebooks will establish a connection automatically.

### Part 1: Data Exploration <a name="part-1-data-exploration"></a>

1. Start with the DO1 notebook.
2. Launch all the cells until you reach "Jump 1.1" (before Part 3).
3. Do the same operations with the DO2 notebook from where you stopped at Part 0 until you reach "Jump 1.2" (before Part 3).

### Part 2: Data Processing <a name="part-2-data-processing"></a>

1. Start with a DS notebook.
2. Launch the cells before an indication (Jump 2.1) in subchapter 2.2 to get to the DO1 notebook.
3. In the DO1 notebook, launch everything until you reach "Jump 2.2" (entire PART 3 in DO1).
4. After that, return to the DS notebook.
5. Repeat the same steps for the DO2 notebook until you see the title of the next part.

### Part 3: Final Steps <a name="part-3-final-steps"></a>

1. Read the introduction in the DS notebook.
2. Launch the last cell in DO1.
3. After that, launch the last cell in DO2.
4. After completing the above steps, proceed with the DS notebook for this and the remaining parts. No more jumps are needed.

Please follow these instructions carefully to navigate through the notebooks effectively. Enjoy your exploration and data processing journey!
